        <h2 id="modern-symbolic-ai-and-automated-reasoning">Modern Symbolic AI and Automated Reasoning</h2>
<p>(<em>CIS 700</em> (a Special Topics course) at Syracuse U)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: parts of this syllabus are subject to change with adequate
notice to students.</p>

<p>The goal of this course is to give students a broad survey of the
research landscape in modern symbolic artificial intelligence and
automated reasoning/deduction. The course will involve six homeworks,
along with a paper presentation (every student must present at least
once).</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<ul>
  <li>84% – Six Homeworks (14% each)</li>
  <li>10% – Present a paper</li>
  <li>6% – Participation</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="homeworks-84">Homeworks (84%)</h4>

<p>There will be six homeworks. Homework will line up (roughly) with the
class contents. Homeworks may be completed in groups (more details
provided in class), but if you work in a group, your group must <em>meet</em>
(either in person or synchronous online meeting such as Zoom) and work
/ discuss all problems together.</p>

<p>If you are a CS PhD student, you <em>must</em> write your homework solutions
in either LaTeX or Typist. I recommend Overleaf.</p>

<h4 id="lead-a-paper-discussion-10">Lead a Paper Discussion (10%)</h4>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> lead at least one paper discussion.  For this paper
discussion, you must bring slides or well-typed notes which give
several examples that you could walk through, and you are responsible
for ensuring you have enough to say about the paper so that we can
fill a class full, although I will help. You must understand the paper
to the best of your ability. If you do not understand it fully,
dedicate time to reading it and clearly articulate your confusion when
you present it–we will try to clear it up together.</p>

<p>Do not wait to start doing this–presenting is a key part of being a
researcher, and one I want you to practice. I will not grade too
harshly–think of this mostly as participation points, as long as you
put forth good effort and lead a good discussion, I am happy to give
you feedback you can use to improve.</p>

<h4 id="participation-paper-discussion-and-course-notes-6">Participation, Paper Discussion, and Course Notes (6%)</h4>

<p>Each week we will have a Google Groups thread on the week’s material
and paper we are reading. You are required to write at least one
substantive response, in the form of either (a) a set of course notes
for the week (in PDF form), providing at least one example (preferably
two or more). Or (b) you may offer a detailed critique and commentary
on a paper.</p>

<p>Essentially: you must make at least one substantive comment on the
class Google Group each week. Be thoughtful and treat this as
professional discourse, rigorously engaging with the ideas of the
course. At the end of the course, I will make all notes public–if you
would prefer I not use your name, please let me know.</p>

<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>

<p>The following is a nonexhaustive list of topics. Topics will follow
papers and may change based on student interest or course direction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classical and intuitionistic propositional logic</li>
  <li>Proof theory / natural deduction</li>
  <li>First-Order Logic</li>
  <li>SAT</li>
  <li>SMT</li>
  <li>DPLL</li>
  <li>CDCL</li>
  <li>Model Checking</li>
  <li>IC3</li>
  <li>PDR</li>
  <li>Datalog</li>
  <li>The Chase</li>
  <li>Resolution-based theorem proving</li>
  <li>Equality saturation</li>
  <li>Higher-order logic</li>
  <li>Temporal logic</li>
  <li>Interactive theorem proving</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="collaboration-and-the-honor-code">Collaboration and the Honor Code</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Do not cheat in the course, cheating is taken even more seriously
for graduate students than for undergraduates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaboration is explicitly allowed on many assignments, except for
where otherwise noted. All work that a student represents as their
own must be completed by the student (with allowed help). Using
ChatGPT is permissible–if you use it, you must describe how you
used it and convince me you didn’t use it to generate junk.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="student-support">Student Support</h2>

<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed
to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I
invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or
accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your
success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services
(ODS) in this process.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register
with ODS, please visit their website at
http://disabilityservices.syr.edu. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email
disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.</p>

<p>ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic
accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access
plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and
generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon
as possible to begin this process.</p>

<h2 id="student-mental-health">Student Mental Health</h2>

<p>Mental health and overall well-being are significant predictors of
academic success. As such it is essential that during your college
experience you develop the skills and resources effectively to
navigate stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health
concerns. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the
Barnes Center provides (https://ese.syr.edu/bewell) and seek out
support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are
available 24/7, 365 days a year, at 315.443.8000.</p>

<h2 id="discrimination-and-harassment">Discrimination and Harassment</h2>

<p>The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or
discrimination related to any protected category including creed,
ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex,
gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color,
veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation,
domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender
expression or perceived gender.</p>

<p>Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these
protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the
Universitys Chief Equal Opportunity &amp; Title IX Officer. She is
responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws
including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and
Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse,
NY 13244-1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone:
315-443-0211.</p>

<p>If you notice any incidents of harassment or discrimination, however
minor, please email me. You may wish to use an anonymous email service
such as https://anonymousemail.me/. Please feel free to tell me as
much as you feel comfortable.  I am a mandatory Title IX reporter and
must report incidents such as sexual harassment, relationship
violence, stalking, etc…</p>
